Consider the following argument written in english:

If it is raining then the ground is wet.
It is raining.
----------------------------------------
Therefore, the ground is wet.

This argument can be symbolized using letters to replace each proposition:

P->Q. P C: Q

where P is 'that is is raining' and Q is 'that the ground is wet'.

We can show the logical validity of this argument using a derivation.
Each derivation begins with a 'Show' statement, so first we can either
type 'Show Q' or 'Show C' to indicate that we are about to prove
the conclusion.



Now that we have our 'Show' statment, we can begin deriving it.
There are three ways that you can derive a conclusion:

Direct Derivation (DD)
Indirect Derivation (ID)
Conditional Derivation (CD)

Since this argument is so simple, it suffices to use DD to derive Q.
To do this, all we need to do is produce Q and then instanctiate the DD Rule.

We currently have two premises to work with: P->Q and P.
We currently only have 1 rule at our disposal: Modus Ponens (MP)

Modus Ponens is the most foundational logical rule. It states that
if I have P->Q and I have P, then I have Q. So to derive Q all I need
is one instantiation of MP. To do this I can type the command
'MP PR1 PR2' or 'MP PR2 PR1'
This will indicate that I intend to use MP rule on the first and second
premises of the argument. Go ahead and try this command.

PR1: P->Q PR2: P C: Q
Show Q



As you can see the instantiation of the MP rule gives us Q. This also happens
to be the exact proposition that we are attemping to derive.

To finish the derivation, we simply have to state that we have solved this 
through direct derivation by inputting the DD command. So let's finish the
derivation by typeing 'DD 0'.

PR1: P->Q PR2: P C: Q
Show Q
0: Q 



Congratulations, you have solved your first derivation. Direct derivations like
these are just one way to show the validity of an argument. There is also
inderect derivations (ID) and Conditional derivations (CD) which will be covered
in the next few tutorials. Before moving on, you can try to practice DD more on
the Working with Conditionals problem set. See how many you can solve by just
using DD and the simplest rules of MP and MT. For more info on MT, type 'help'
while you are solving a derivation to view documentation for all of the available
rules.
