Consider the following argument written in english:

If it is raining then the ground is wet.
It is raining.
----------------------------------------
Therefore, the ground is wet.

This argument can be symbolized using letters to replace each proposition:

P->Q. P C: Q

where P is 'that is is raining' and Q is 'that the ground is wet'.

We can show the logical validity of this argument using a derivation.
Each derivation begins with a 'Show' statement, so first we can either
type 'Show P' or 'Show C' to indicate that we are about to prove
the conclusion.
