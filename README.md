# Logic2018
Logic 2018 is a remake of Logic 2010, an educational logic game in which players solve logical derivations by instantiating logical rules.

# Installation
The first build is currently unfinished. There is no tutorial so most people will not be able to play it. Once the tutorial is finished a self-contained build will be available for download.<br>
If you wish to test out the current unfinished build you can download the dotnet SDK, clone the git, and run the program via "dotnet run" command.

# Future Direction
The program is currently fully command-line based with only 1 problem set in sentential logic and a few rules.<br>
Alpha Release:<br>
-Alpha will contain the first problem set with a tutorial showing the player how to solve sentential derivations with the given rules.<br>
-More rules and problem sets will then be added<br>
-Predicate logic will then be added with new rules and problem sets<br>
<br>
Beta Release:<br>
-Beta release will introduce a GUI interface using the Unity Engine<br>
-Web and Mobile will also be introduced and tested<br>
<br>
Final Release:<br>
-The full final release will be available in the Web as well as on Mobile so that students can solve derivations wherever they go<br>
-Integration with actual Logic courses will also be offered
