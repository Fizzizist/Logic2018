# Logic2018
Logic 2018 is a remake of Logic 2010, an educational logic game in which players solve logical derivations by instantiating logical rules.

# Installation
The first build is currently unfinished. There is no tutorial so most people will not be able to play it. Once the tutorial is finished a self-contained build will be available for download.
If you wish to test out the current unfinished build you can download the dotnet SDK, clone the git, and run the program via "dotnet run" command.

# Future Direction
The program is currently fully command-line based with only 1 problem set in sentential logic and a few rules.
Alpha Release:
-Alpha will contain the first problem set with a tutorial showing the player how to solve sentential derivations with the given rules.
-More rules and problem sets will then be added
-Predicate logic will then be added with new rules and problem sets

Beta Release:
-Beta release will introduce a GUI interface using the Unity Engine
-Web and Mobile will also be introduced and tested

Final Release:
-The full final release will be available in the Web as well as on Mobile so that students can solve derivations wherever they go
-Integration with actual Logic courses will also be offered
